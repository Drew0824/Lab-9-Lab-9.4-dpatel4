# Greetings Generator

Write a program that:
- Asks for the user’s name.
- Asks the user to input a number between 1 and 5.
- Outputs a personalized greeting (that includes the user’s name) depending on which number they picked (each number should have a unique greeting).

_Example run:_
 
Hi, what's your name? __Hector__
Pick a number between 1 and 5: **3**
Greetings and salutations Hector!
